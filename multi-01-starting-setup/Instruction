Run node app.js in the backend part
Run npm start in the frontend part

Dockerizing the MongoDB Service

1. docker run --name mongodb --rm -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
2. stop the backend then re-run it again
 a. docker logs mongodb: to check if the frontend connected to the backend

Build the image based on the dockerfile!

1. docker build -t goals-node .
2. docker run --name goals-backend --rm goals-node

FAILED TO CONNECT TO MONGODB

Change the app.js as following:
mongoose.connect(
  'mongodb://host.docker.internal:27017/course-goals',
  {....
  ...

rebuild this image and then run the container! Wow CONNECTED TO MONGODB

BUT still there's a problem that the backend can't connect to frontend
1. stop the container goals-backend and re run the container with detached mode:
docker run --name goals-backend --rm -d -p 80:80 goals-node

NOW EVERYTHING WORKS FINE!
