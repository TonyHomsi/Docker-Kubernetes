Let's build our app:
1- docker build -t favorites-node .
2- docker run --name favorites -d --rm -p 3000:3000 favorites-node

Nothing happens !! What's wrong about that!
Remove -d from the docker run to see what exactly the problem is!! => 
"MongoNetworkError: failed to connect to server [localhost:27017] on first connect"

Uncomment the part of MongoDB connect in app.js but keep app.listen(3000)

test your app using postman! it works fine (localhost:3000/people)!

### Re comment the part of MongoDB! ###
