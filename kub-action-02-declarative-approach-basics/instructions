After adding deplyment.yaml file, run:
kubectl apply -f=deployment.yaml
check: kubectl get deployments
check: kubectl get pods

Now let add service.yaml file!
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
kubectl get services
now we can expose it by:
minikube service backend


delete the deployment & service:

kubectl delete -f=deployment.yaml -f=service.yaml

we can merge two yaml files, ex: master-deployment.yaml, then run
kubectl apply -f=master-deployment.yaml

now run:
minikube service backend


Now adding lables to both files dep & service
  labels:
    group: example

delete the master-deployment:
kubectl delete -f=master-deployment.yaml

now create them again:
kubectl apply -f=deployment.yaml -f=service.yaml


Now delete them using labels:
kubectl delete -l group=example for more security use this command as following:
kubectl delete deployments,services -l group=example
